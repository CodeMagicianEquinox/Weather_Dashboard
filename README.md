# 🌤️ Weather Dashboard

This is a simple and responsive **Weather Dashboard** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates real-time temperature conversion and conditional logic via user interaction with the browser.

## Features

- 🔁 **Temperature Conversion** between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- ⌨️ **User Prompt Input** for temperature scale and value
- 💡 **Interactive Interface** using JavaScript alert, prompt, and console
- 🖼️ Includes weather-themed images and layout elements for UI enhancement

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (inline/basic styling)
- JavaScript (vanilla JS, prompt/alert/if-statements)
- Image assets (.avif and .jpg)

## ✨ What I Worked On

- Built custom temperature conversion logic using conditionals and mathematical operations
- Created multiple interactive HTML/JS demos for:
  - `if-statements`
  - `loops`
  - General JavaScript fundamentals
- Developed and organized multiple HTML/JS files to demonstrate different logic flows
- Integrated weather-themed images for visual enhancement

## 📂 Project Structure

- `assignment3.html / .js` – Main interactive temperature converter
- `if-statements.html / .js` – Demonstration of if/else conditionals
- `loops.js` – JavaScript loop exercises
- `temp.html / temp.js` – Additional temperature logic variations
- `Tempdashboard.html / .js` – Final combined dashboard logic
- `sun.jpg` and `.avif` assets – Weather-related graphics

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the ZIP
2. Open any of the HTML files in your browser (e.g., `Tempdashboard.html`)
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to test temperature conversion
